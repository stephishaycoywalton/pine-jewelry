Pine Jewelry

The Pine Jewelry project was a very expansive project. I was provided a psd for the mobile and desktop version of a 1-page site. It was my assignment to convert this psd into a working one-page website. 

It was explained, that in the industry, the front end developer will be given a .psd, .ai, .sketch, or even a psd of what the site is expected to look like. It becomes the developer's job to take that design and turn it into a working/responsive page. I was the developer for this project.  

Deliverables:
Project folder with index.html, styles.css, an images folder with only the modified/resized images in it. 
Total project folder size should be under 4MB.
The form did not need to work, the navigation is links to nowhere but the mobile nav works (but does not link). 
Site is responsive between 320px to 1440px and match the documents at 320px wide and 1440px wide.
